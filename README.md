# Handwritten Digit Recognition with MNIST

## Overview
This project uses a deep learning model to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The model leverages neural networks to achieve high accuracy in digit recognition.

## Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Normalizes and reshapes the MNIST data.  
- **Visualization:** Includes data exploration and visualization of digit images.  
- **Deep Learning Model:** Implements a neural network with TensorFlow/Keras.  

## Tools & Libraries
- TensorFlow/Keras  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  


## Results
Achieves excellent classification accuracy on test data. 
## Future Scope
- Extend to recognize additional datasets like Fashion MNIST.  
- Deploy as a web or mobile app for real-time digit recognition.
